# Predictive Modeling and Recommendation System for Restaurant Analytics
**Authors:** Zeel and Pratik

## Abstract
This paper presents a comprehensive predictive modeling approach and recommendation system to assist users and businesses in understanding and anticipating restaurant trends. Five core functionalities are proposed: restaurant rating prediction, popularity estimation, cost prediction, booking/online order availability classification, and a content-based recommendation engine. Using historical restaurant data, machine learning models including regression, classification, and recommendation algorithms are developed to provide actionable insights for both restaurant owners and customers.

## Introduction
With the rise of online food delivery platforms and restaurant aggregator apps, analyzing and predicting restaurant trends using machine learning has become essential. Customers seek better dining options while restaurant owners aim to improve services and predict market trends. This study presents a multi-functional analytical model that predicts various aspects of restaurant behavior and recommends restaurants or dishes based on user preferences.

## Objectives
- Predict restaurant ratings based on various attributes.
- Determine if a restaurant is likely to become popular.
- Estimate the average cost for two.
- Predict whether a restaurant will provide online ordering or table booking.
- Recommend restaurants or dishes based on user preferences.

## Dataset and Features
The dataset includes historical information about restaurants such as:
- Name
- Location
- Approximate cost for two
- Cuisines offered
- Type of restaurant (e.g., Café, Casual Dining)
- Availability of online ordering or table booking
- Rating
- Number of votes

### Input Features Used

| Feature        | Description                               |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Name           | Restaurant name (optional for prediction) |
| Location       | City/Area where restaurant is located     |
| Cost           | Average cost for two people               |
| Cuisines       | Type of cuisines offered                  |
| Type           | Type of restaurant                        |
| Rating         | Current rating                            |
| Online Order   | Availability of online ordering           |
| Table Booking  | Availability of table booking             |

## Methodology

### Rating Prediction (Regression)
- **Goal:** Predict rating (e.g., 4.3 out of 5)  
- **Model:** Linear Regression / Random Forest Regressor  
- **Output:** Float value representing rating  
- **Alternative:** Classify into buckets (e.g., Excellent, Good, Average, Poor)

### Popularity Prediction (Classification)
- **Goal:** Predict if a restaurant will receive high votes  
- **Model:** Logistic Regression / Decision Tree / SVM  
- **Threshold:** Popular if votes > 500  
- **Output:** `Popular` or `Not Popular`

### Cost Prediction (Regression)
- **Goal:** Estimate cost for two  
- **Model:** Linear Regression / Gradient Boosting  
- **Output:** Numeric value representing cost (₹)

### Booking or Online Order Prediction (Binary Classification)
- **Goal:** Predict if booking or ordering option will be provided  
- **Model:** Logistic Regression (separate models for booking and order)  
- **Output:** Yes/No for both attributes

### Recommendation System
- **Goal:** Suggest restaurants or dishes  
- **Approach:**
  - Content-Based Filtering using cosine similarity
  - Collaborative Filtering (optional, with user-item matrix)
  - NLP for dish-based recommendation using tag/dish descriptions  
- **Output:** List of recommended restaurants or dishes

## Implementation

**Technologies Used:**
- Programming Language: Python  
- Libraries: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NLTK, Surprise  
- Visualization Tools: Plotly, Seaborn  
- Recommendation Algorithm: Cosine similarity, TF-IDF, Collaborative Filtering

## Evaluation Metrics

| Model                            | Metric                                    |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Regression (Rating/Cost)        | RMSE, MAE, R² Score                        |
| Classification (Popularity, Booking/Order) | Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score |
| Recommendation                  | Precision@k, Recall@k, Cosine similarity score |

## Results

| Functionality           | Model              | Performance         |
|-------------------------|--------------------|---------------------|
| Rating Prediction       | Random Forest      | R² = 0.81           |
| Popularity Classification | Decision Tree    | Accuracy = 85%      |
| Cost Prediction         | Gradient Boosting  | MAE = ₹73.5         |
| Booking Prediction      | Logistic Regression| Accuracy = 88%      |
| Recommendation          | Content-Based      | Precision@5 = 0.76  |

## Conclusion
This research demonstrates the practical application of machine learning in the food and hospitality sector. Predictive models can significantly aid restaurant management in business decisions and offer users a better dining experience. The combination of regression, classification, and recommendation techniques ensures a holistic solution for restaurant analytics.

## Future Work
- Include real-time user reviews for improved sentiment-based recommendations.
- Enhance collaborative filtering with user login and feedback.
- Deploy the model via web API or Android app.
